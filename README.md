## Journey of the project
### 💡 Inspiration
I suck at curating music and I keep lisiting to the same songs over and over again. I wanted to create a script that would create a playlist for me based upon my mood. I also wanted to learn how to use the Spotify API and the Requests library.

### ⚙️ How it started
It started with an overwhelming idea that I needed to build in 25 hours with an exam the day after but as I started working on it, I realised that it was was hard but as much and python being such amazing language helped me build it in less than 5 hours.

As a 16-year-old, my code may not be the most efficient but it worked and I can't be happier with the result 😋

### 🥹 Fun Fact
I created this project with my younger sister who had her first hackathon experience and she loved it. She is now a huge fan of hackathons and is planning to participate in more hackathons in the future.
